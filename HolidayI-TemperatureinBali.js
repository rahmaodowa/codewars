/*
So it turns out the weather in Indonesia is beautiful... but also far too hot most of the time.
Given two variables: heat (0 - 50 degrees centigrade) and humidity (scored from 0.0 - 1.0), your job is to test whether the weather is bareable (according to my personal preferences :D)
Rules for my personal preferences
i. if humidity > 0.5 or the heat >= 36, it's unbearable return false
ii. if 25 < heat < 36 and the humidity > 0.4, also unbearable return false
iii. otherwise, it's sunbathing time :), return true
Examples
> heat = 36, humdity = 0.3 -> return false
> heat = 36, humdity = 0.5 -> return false
> heat = 10, humdity = 0.51 -> return false
-> triggered rule 1
> heat = 27, humdity = 0.5 -> return false
-> triggered rule 2
> heat = 27, humdity = 0.4 -> return true
> heat = 25, humdity = 0.5 -> return true
> heat = 33, humdity = 0.38 -> return true
-> triggered rule 3
Goodluck!

function bareable(heat, humidity){
  if(humidity > 0.5 || heat >= 36) return false
  else if(25 < heat && heat < 36 && humidity > 0.4) return false
  else if(heat <= 25) return false
  else return true

}
