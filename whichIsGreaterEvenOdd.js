Given a string of digits confirm whether the sum of all the individual even digits are greater than the sum of all the indiviudal odd digits. Always a string of numbers will be given.
If the sum of even numbers is greater than the odd numbers return: "Even is greater than Odd"
If the sum of odd numbers is greater than the sum of even numbers return: "Odd is greater than Even"
If the total of both even and odd numbers are identical return: "Even and Odd are the same"
